# Abhinav Pokhrel
**Security Operations | SOC Automation | Cloud Monitoring & Incident Response**

Cybersecurity graduate with hands-on experience designing and implementing **security operations workflows** across alert triage, phishing response, and cloud monitoring. My work focuses on improving **detection quality, analyst decision-making, and incident response consistency** through automation, structured logic, and audit-aware design. All projects are built to reflect **real-world SOC and cloud security environments**, not academic simulations.
